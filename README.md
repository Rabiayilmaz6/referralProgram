# README

* Overview
This repository implements a referral program that allows users to invite others to the system using unique referral codes. The referral program is designed to reward both the inviter (Davet√ßi) and the invitee (Davet edilen) based on specific credit loading thresholds. This document describes the architecture, functionality, and implementation details.

* Features
Unique Referral Codes: Each inviter has a unique referral code that can be shared with others.
Invitee Registration: Invitees can use a referral code during registration to associate themselves with an inviter.
Inviter Management: Invited users are tracked in a list associated with their inviter.
Credit Rewards: Both invitees and inviters receive rewards based on credit loading amounts.

* Workflow
User Registration with Referral Code:

A new user enters a referral code during registration.
The system validates the referral code and associates the new user with the inviter.
Adding to Inviter's List:

The invitee is added to the inviter's invited_users list.
Credit Loading:

The invitee loads credits to their account.
The system calculates rewards for both the invitee and the inviter based on the Credit Rewards table.
Reward Distribution:

Rewards are stored in the Referral model, linked to the respective referral relationship.
